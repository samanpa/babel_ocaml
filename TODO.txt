- unify dyn/lambda.ml with codegen/cgil.ml

- Let variables carry their types
  A variable is currently defined in cgil as
    Lvar (name)
  We want it to be 
    Lvar (type, name)

  Advantages
  - Makes finding types in cgil much easier

  Disadvantages
  - Memory overhead. Not necessary since a hashmap does the same job
    and a hashmap is needed anyway
